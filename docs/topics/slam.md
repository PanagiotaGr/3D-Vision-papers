  Generalization of imitation-learned navigation policies to environments unseen in training remains a major challenge. We address this by conducting the first large-scale study of how data quantity and data diversity affect real-world generalization in end-to-end, map-free visual navigation. Using a curated 4,565-hour crowd-sourced dataset collected across 161 locations in 35 countries, we train policies for point goal navigation and evaluate their closed-loop control performance on sidewalk robots operating in four countries, covering 125 km of autonomous driving. Our results show that large-scale training data enables zero-shot navigation in unknown environments, approaching the performance of policies trained with environment-specific demonstrations. Critically, we find that data diversity is far more important than data quantity. Doubling the number of geographical locations in a training set decreases navigation errors by ~15%, while performance benefit from adding data from existing locations saturates with very little data. We also observe that, with noisy crowd-sourced data, simple regression-based models outperform generative and sequence-based architectures. We release our policies, evaluation setup and example videos on the project page.
