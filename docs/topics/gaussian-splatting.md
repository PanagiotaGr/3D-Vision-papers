  Digital human generation has been studied for decades and supports a wide range of real-world applications. However, most existing systems are passively animated, relying on privileged state or scripted control, which limits scalability to novel environments. We instead ask: how can digital humans actively behave using only visual observations and specified goals in novel scenes? Achieving this would enable populating any 3D environments with digital humans at scale that exhibit spontaneous, natural, goal-directed behaviors. To this end, we introduce Visually-grounded Humanoid Agents, a coupled two-layer (world-agent) paradigm that replicates humans at multiple levels: they look, perceive, reason, and behave like real people in real-world 3D scenes. The World Layer reconstructs semantically rich 3D Gaussian scenes from real-world videos via an occlusion-aware pipeline and accommodates animatable Gaussian-based human avatars. The Agent Layer transforms these avatars into autonomous humanoid agents, equipping them with first-person RGB-D perception and enabling them to perform accurate, embodied planning with spatial awareness and iterative reasoning, which is then executed at the low level as full-body actions to drive their behaviors in the scene. We further introduce a benchmark to evaluate humanoid-scene interaction in diverse reconstructed environments. Experiments show our agents achieve robust autonomous behavior, yielding higher task success rates and fewer collisions than ablations and state-of-the-art planning methods. This work enables active digital human population and advances human-centric embodied AI. Data, code, and models will be open-sourced.

  In unstructured environments, functional dexterous grasping calls for the tight integration of semantic understanding, precise 3D functional localization, and physically interpretable execution. Modular hierarchical methods are more controllable and interpretable than end-to-end VLA approaches, but existing ones still rely on predefined affordance labels and lack the tight semantic--pose coupling needed for functional dexterous manipulation. To address this, we propose BLaDA (Bridging Language to Dexterous Actions in 3DGS fields), an interpretable zero-shot framework that grounds open-vocabulary instructions as perceptual and control constraints for functional dexterous manipulation. BLaDA establishes an interpretable reasoning chain by first parsing natural language into a structured sextuple of manipulation constraints via a Knowledge-guided Language Parsing (KLP) module. To achieve pose-consistent spatial reasoning, we introduce the Triangular Functional Point Localization (TriLocation) module, which utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting as a continuous scene representation and identifies functional regions under triangular geometric constraints. Finally, the 3D Keypoint Grasp Matrix Transformation Execution (KGT3D+) module decodes these semantic-geometric constraints into physically plausible wrist poses and finger-level commands. Extensive experiments on complex benchmarks demonstrate that BLaDA significantly outperforms existing methods in both affordance grounding precision and the success rate of functional manipulation across diverse categories and tasks.

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Beyond novel view synthesis, it shows great potential for multi-view surface reconstruction. Existing methods employ optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that achieve precise and complete surface extractions. However, these approaches typically require dense input views and high time consumption for per-scene optimization. To address these limitations, we propose SurfelSplat, a feed-forward framework that generates efficient and generalizable pixel-aligned Gaussian surfel representations from sparse-view images. We observe that conventional feed-forward structures struggle to recover accurate geometric attributes of Gaussian surfels because the spatial frequency of pixel-aligned primitives exceeds Nyquist sampling rates. Therefore, we propose a cross-view feature aggregation module based on the Nyquist sampling theorem. Specifically, we first adapt the geometric forms of Gaussian surfels with spatial sampling rate-guided low-pass filters. We then project the filtered surfels across all input views to obtain cross-view feature correlations. By processing these correlations through a specially designed feature fusion network, we can finally regress Gaussian surfels with precise geometry. Extensive experiments on DTU reconstruction benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art methods, and predict Gaussian surfels within 1 second, offering a 100x speedup without costly per-scene training.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Egocentric video is crucial for next-generation 4D scene reconstruction, with applications in AR/VR and embodied AI. However, reconstructing dynamic first-person scenes is challenging due to complex ego-motion, occlusions, and hand-object interactions. Existing decomposition methods are ill-suited, assuming fixed viewpoints or merging dynamics into a single foreground. To address these limitations, we introduce DP-DeGauss, a dynamic probabilistic Gaussian decomposition framework for egocentric 4D reconstruction. Our method initializes a unified 3D Gaussian set from COLMAP priors, augments each with a learnable category probability, and dynamically routes them into specialized deformation branches for background, hands, or object modeling. We employ category-specific masks for better disentanglement and introduce brightness and motion-flow control to improve static rendering and dynamic reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that DP-DeGauss outperforms baselines by +1.70dB in PSNR on average with SSIM and LPIPS gains. More importantly, our framework achieves the first and state-of-the-art disentanglement of background, hand, and object components, enabling explicit, fine-grained separation, paving the way for more intuitive ego scene understanding and editing.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  While AI-based numerical weather prediction (NWP) enables rapid forecasting, generating high-resolution outputs remains computationally demanding due to limited multi-scale adaptability and inefficient data representations. We propose the 3D Gaussian splatting-based scale-aware vision transformer (GSSA-ViT), a novel framework for arbitrary-resolution forecasting and flexible downscaling of high-dimensional atmospheric fields. Specifically, latitude-longitude grid points are treated as centers of 3D Gaussians. A generative 3D Gaussian prediction scheme is introduced to estimate key parameters, including covariance, attributes, and opacity, for unseen samples, improving generalization and mitigating overfitting. In addition, a scale-aware attention module is designed to capture cross-scale dependencies, enabling the model to effectively integrate information across varying downscaling ratios and support continuous resolution adaptation. To our knowledge, this is the first NWP approach that combines generative 3D Gaussian modeling with scale-aware attention for unified multi-scale prediction. Experiments on ERA5 show that the proposed method accurately forecasts 87 atmospheric variables at arbitrary resolutions, while evaluations on ERA5 and CMIP6 demonstrate its superior performance in downscaling tasks. The proposed framework provides an efficient and scalable solution for high-resolution, multi-scale atmospheric prediction and downscaling.

  Reconstructing non-rigid objects with physical plausibility remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches leverage differentiable rendering for per-scene optimization, recovering geometry and dynamics but requiring expensive tuning or manual annotation, which limits practicality and generalizability. To address this, we propose ReconPhys, the first feedforward framework that jointly learns physical attribute estimation and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction from a single monocular video. Our method employs a dual-branch architecture trained via a self-supervised strategy, eliminating the need for ground-truth physics labels. Given a video sequence, ReconPhys simultaneously infers geometry, appearance, and physical attributes. Experiments on a large-scale synthetic dataset demonstrate superior performance: our method achieves 21.64 PSNR in future prediction compared to 13.27 by state-of-the-art optimization baselines, while reducing Chamfer Distance from 0.349 to 0.004. Crucially, ReconPhys enables fast inference (<1 second) versus hours required by existing methods, facilitating rapid generation of simulation-ready assets for robotics and graphics.

- **GEAR: GEometry-motion Alternating Refinement for Articulated Object Modeling with Gaussian Splatting**  
  Jialin Li, Bin Fu, Ruiping Wang, Xilin Chen  
  _2026-04-09_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.07728v1  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  High-fidelity interactive digital assets are essential for embodied intelligence and robotic interaction, yet articulated objects remain challenging to reconstruct due to their complex structures and coupled geometry-motion relationships. Existing methods suffer from instability in geometry-motion joint optimization, while their generalization remains limited on complex multi-joint or out-of-distribution objects. To address these challenges, we propose GEAR, an EM-style alternating optimization framework that jointly models geometry and motion as interdependent components within a Gaussian Splatting representation. GEAR treats part segmentation as a latent variable and joint motion parameters as explicit variables, alternately refining them for improved convergence and geometric-motion consistency. To enhance part segmentation quality without sacrificing generalization, we leverage a vanilla 2D segmentation model to provide multi-view part priors, and employ a weakly supervised constraint to regularize the latent variable. Experiments on multiple benchmarks and our newly constructed dataset GEAR-Multi demonstrate that GEAR achieves state-of-the-art results in geometric reconstruction and motion parameters estimation, particularly on complex articulated objects with multiple movable parts.

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized fast novel view synthesis, yet its opacity-based formulation makes surface extraction fundamentally difficult. Unlike implicit methods built on Signed Distance Fields or occupancy, 3DGS lacks a global geometric field, forcing existing approaches to resort to heuristics such as TSDF fusion of blended depth maps. Inspired by the Objects as Volumes framework, we derive a principled occupancy field for Gaussian Splatting and show how it can be used to extract highly accurate watertight meshes of complex scenes. Our key contribution is to introduce a learnable oriented normal at each Gaussian element and to define an adapted attenuation formulation, which leads to closed-form expressions for both the normal and occupancy fields at arbitrary locations in space. We further introduce a novel consistency loss and a dedicated densification strategy to enforce Gaussians to wrap the entire surface by closing geometric holes, ensuring a complete shell of oriented primitives. We modify the differentiable rasterizer to output depth as an isosurface of our continuous model, and introduce Primal Adaptive Meshing for Region-of-Interest meshing at arbitrary resolution. We additionally expose fundamental biases in standard surface evaluation protocols and propose two more rigorous alternatives. Overall, our method Gaussian Wrapping sets a new state-of-the-art on DTU and Tanks and Temples, producing complete, watertight meshes at a fraction of the size of concurrent work-recovering thin structures such as the notoriously elusive bicycle spokes.

  We investigate the feasibility of real-time 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) rasterisation on edge clients with varying Gaussian splat counts and GPU computational budgets. Instead of evaluating multiple physical devices, we adopt an emulation-based approach that approximates different GPU capability tiers on a single high-end GPU. By systematically under-clocking the GPU core frequency and applying power caps, we emulate a controlled range of floating-point performance levels that approximate different GPU capability tiers. At each point in this range, we measure frame rate, runtime behaviour, and power consumption across scenes of varying complexity, pipelines, and optimisations, enabling analysis of power-performance relationships such as FPS-power curves, energy per frame, and performance per watt. This method allows us to approximate the performance envelope of a diverse class of GPUs, from embedded and mobile-class devices to high-end consumer-grade systems. Our objective is to explore the practical lower bounds of client-side 3DGS rasterisation and assess its potential for deployment in energy-constrained environments, including standalone headsets and thin clients. Through this analysis, we provide early insights into the performance-energy trade-offs that govern the viability of edge-deployed 3DGS systems.

- **AnchorSplat: Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting with 3D Geometric Priors**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Recent feed-forward Gaussian reconstruction models adopt a pixel-aligned formulation that maps each 2D pixel to a 3D Gaussian, entangling Gaussian representations tightly with the input images. In this paper, we propose AnchorSplat, a novel feed-forward 3DGS framework for scene-level reconstruction that represents the scene directly in 3D space. AnchorSplat introduces an anchor-aligned Gaussian representation guided by 3D geometric priors (e.g., sparse point clouds, voxels, or RGB-D point clouds), enabling a more geometry-aware renderable 3D Gaussians that is independent of image resolution and number of views. This design substantially reduces the number of required Gaussians, improving computational efficiency while enhancing reconstruction fidelity. Beyond the anchor-aligned design, we utilize a Gaussian Refiner to adjust the intermediate Gaussiansy via merely a few forward passes. Experiments on the ScanNet++ v2 NVS benchmark demonstrate the SOTA performance, outperforming previous methods with more view-consistent and substantially fewer Gaussian primitives.

- **DOC-GS: Dual-Domain Observation and Calibration for Reliable Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting**

  Sparse-view reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is fundamentally ill-posed due to insufficient geometric supervision, often leading to severe overfitting and the emergence of structural distortions and translucent haze-like artifacts. While existing approaches attempt to alleviate this issue via dropout-based regularization, they are largely heuristic and lack a unified understanding of artifact formation. In this paper, we revisit sparse-view 3DGS reconstruction from a new perspective and identify the core challenge as the unobservability of Gaussian primitive reliability. Unreliable Gaussians are insufficiently constrained during optimization and accumulate as haze-like degradations in rendered images. Motivated by this observation, we propose a unified Dual-domain Observation and Calibration (DOC-GS) framework that models and corrects Gaussian reliability through the synergy of optimization-domain inductive bias and observation-domain evidence. Specifically, in the optimization domain, we characterize Gaussian reliability by the degree to which each primitive is constrained during training, and instantiate this signal via a Continuous Depth-Guided Dropout (CDGD) strategy, where the dropout probability serves as an explicit proxy for primitive reliability. This imposes a smooth depth-aware inductive bias to suppress weakly constrained Gaussians and improve optimization stability. In the observation domain, we establish a connection between floater artifacts and atmospheric scattering, and leverage the Dark Channel Prior (DCP) as a structural consistency cue to identify and accumulate anomalous regions. Based on cross-view aggregated evidence, we further design a reliability-driven geometric pruning strategy to remove low-confidence Gaussians.

  Introduction: Mechanical thrombectomy can cause vessel deformation and procedure-related injury. Benchtop models are widely used for device testing, but time-resolved, full-field 3D vessel-motion measurements remain limited. Methods: We developed a nine-camera, low-cost multi-view workflow for benchtop thrombectomy in silicone middle cerebral artery phantoms (2160p, 20 fps). Multi-view videos were calibrated, segmented, and reconstructed with 4D Gaussian Splatting. Reconstructed point clouds were converted to fixed-connectivity edge graphs for region-of-interest (ROI) displacement tracking and a relative surface-based stress proxy. Stress-proxy values were derived from edge stretch using a Neo-Hookean mapping and reported as comparative surface metrics. A synthetic Blender pipeline with known deformation provided geometric and temporal validation. Results: In synthetic bulk translation, the stress proxy remained near zero for most edges (median $\approx$ 0 MPa; 90th percentile 0.028 MPa), with sparse outliers. In synthetic pulling (1-5 mm), reconstruction showed close geometric and temporal agreement with ground truth, with symmetric Chamfer distance of 1.714-1.815 mm and precision of 0.964-0.972 at $τ= 1$ mm. In preliminary benchtop comparative trials (one trial per condition), cervical aspiration catheter placement showed higher max-median ROI displacement and stress-proxy values than internal carotid artery terminus placement. Conclusion: The proposed protocol provides standardized, time-resolved surface kinematics and comparative relative displacement and stress proxy measurements for thrombectomy benchtop studies. The framework supports condition-to-condition comparisons and methods validation, while remaining distinct from absolute wall-stress estimation.

  Realistic digital avatars require expressive and dynamic hair motion; however, most existing head avatar methods assume rigid hair movement. These methods often fail to disentangle hair from the head, representing it as a simple outer shell and failing to capture its natural volumetric behavior. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing PhysHead, a hybrid representation for animatable head avatars with realistic hair dynamics learned from multi-view video. At the core is a 3D Gaussian-based layered representation of the head. Our approach combines a 3D parametric mesh for the head with strand-based hair, which can be directly simulated using physics engines. For the appearance model, we employ Gaussian primitives attached to both the head mesh and hair segments. This representation enables the creation of photorealistic head avatars with dynamic hair behavior, such as wind-blown motion, overcoming the constraints of rigid hair in existing methods. However, these animation capabilities also require new training schemes. In particular, we propose the use of VLM-based models to generate appearance of regions that are occluded in the dynamic training sequences. In quantitative and qualitative studies, we demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model and compare it with existing baselines. We show that our method can synthesize physically plausible hair motion besides expression and camera control.

  Exploring ensemble simulations is increasingly important across many scientific domains. However, supporting flexible post-hoc exploration remains challenging due to the trade-off between storing the expensive raw data and flexibly adjusting visualization settings. Existing visualization surrogate models have improved this workflow, but they either operate in image space without an explicit 3D representation or rely on neural radiance fields that are computationally expensive for interactive exploration and encode all parameter-driven variations within a single implicit field. In this work, we introduce GS-Surrogate, a deformable Gaussian Splatting-based visualization surrogate for parameter-space exploration. Our method first constructs a canonical Gaussian field as a base 3D representation and adapts it through sequential parameter-conditioned deformations. By separating simulation-related variations from visualization-specific changes, this explicit formulation enables efficient and controllable adaptation to different visualization tasks, such as isosurface extraction and transfer function editing. We evaluate our framework on a range of simulation datasets, demonstrating that GS-Surrogate enables real-time and flexible exploration across both simulation and visualization parameter spaces.
