  Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) enables 3D scene reconstruction from several 2D images but incurs high rendering latency via its point-sampling design. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) improves on NeRF with explicit scene representation and an optimized pipeline yet still fails to meet practical real-time demands. Existing acceleration works overlook the evolving Tensor Cores of modern GPUs because 3DGS pipeline lacks General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operations. This paper proposes GEMM-GS, an acceleration approach utilizing tensor cores on GPUs via GEMM-friendly blending transformation. It equivalently reformulates the 3DGS blending process into a GEMM-compatible form to utilize Tensor Cores. A high-performance CUDA kernel is designed, integrating a three-stage double-buffered pipeline that overlaps computation and memory access. Extensive experiments show that GEMM-GS achieves $1.42\times$ speedup over vanilla 3DGS and provides an additional $1.47\times$ speedup on average when combining with existing acceleration approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Generating ground-level views and coherent 3D site models from aerial-only imagery is challenging due to extreme viewpoint changes, missing intermediate observations, and large scale variations. Existing methods either refine renderings post-hoc, often producing geometrically inconsistent results, or rely on multi-altitude ground-truth, which is rarely available. Gaussian Splatting and diffusion-based refinements improve fidelity under small variations but fail under wide aerial-to-ground gaps. To address these limitations, we introduce ProDiG (Progressive Altitude Gaussian Splatting), a diffusion-guided framework that progressively transforms aerial 3D representations toward ground-level fidelity. ProDiG synthesizes intermediate-altitude views and refines the Gaussian representation at each stage using a geometry-aware causal attention module that injects epipolar structure into reference-view diffusion. A distance-adaptive Gaussian module dynamically adjusts Gaussian scale and opacity based on camera distance, ensuring stable reconstruction across large viewpoint gaps. Together, these components enable progressive, geometrically grounded refinement without requiring additional ground-truth viewpoints. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ProDiG produces visually realistic ground-level renderings and coherent 3D geometry, significantly outperforming existing approaches in terms of visual quality, geometric consistency, and robustness to extreme viewpoint changes.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Physics-driven 4D dynamic simulation from static 3D scenes remains constrained by an overlooked contradiction: reliable motion supervision often relies on online video diffusion or optical-flow pipelines whose computational cost exceeds that of the simulator itself. Existing methods further simplify inverse physical modeling by optimizing only partial material parameters, limiting realism in scenes with complex materials and dynamics. We present Resonance4D, a physics-driven 4D dynamic simulation framework that couples 3D Gaussian Splatting with the Material Point Method through lightweight yet physically expressive supervision. Our key insight is that dynamic consistency can be enforced without dense temporal generation by jointly constraining motion in complementary domains. To this end, we introduce Dual-domain Motion Supervision (DMS), which combines spatial structural consistency for local deformation with frequency-domain spectral consistency for oscillatory and global dynamic patterns, substantially reducing training cost and memory overhead while preserving physically meaningful motion cues. To enable stable full-parameter physical recovery, we further combine zero-shot text-prompted segmentation with simulation-guided initialization to automatically decompose Gaussians into object-part-level regions and support joint optimization of full material parameters. Experiments on both synthetic and real scenes show that Resonance4D achieves strong physical fidelity and motion consistency while reducing peak GPU memory from over 35\,GB to around 20\,GB, enabling high-fidelity physics-driven 4D simulation on a single consumer-grade GPU.

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated breakthrough performance in novel view synthesis and real-time rendering. Nevertheless, its practicality is constrained by the high memory cost due to a huge number of Gaussian points. Many pruning-based 3DGS variants have been proposed for memory saving, but often compromise spatial consistency and may lead to rendering artifacts. To address this issue, we propose graph-based spatial distribution optimization for compact 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS\textasciicircum2), which enhances reconstruction quality by optimizing the spatial distribution of Gaussian points. Specifically, we introduce an evidence lower bound (ELBO)-based adaptive densification strategy that automatically controls the densification process. In addition, an opacity-aware progressive pruning strategy is proposed to further reduce memory consumption by dynamically removing low-opacity Gaussian points. Furthermore, we propose a graph-based feature encoding module to adjust the spatial distribution via feature-guided point shifting. Extensive experiments validate that GS\textasciicircum2 achieves a compact Gaussian representation while delivering superior rendering quality. Compared with 3DGS, it achieves higher PSNR with only about 12.5\% Gaussian points. Furthermore, it outperforms all compared baselines in both rendering quality and memory efficiency.

- **A3R: Agentic Affordance Reasoning via Cross-Dimensional Evidence in 3D Gaussian Scenes**  
  Di Li, Jie Feng, Guanbin Li, Ronghua Shang, Yuhui Zheng, Weisheng Dong, Guangming Shi

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Affordance reasoning in 3D Gaussian scenes aims to identify the region that supports the action specified by a given text instruction in complex environments. Existing methods typically cast this problem as one-shot prediction from static scene observations, assuming sufficient evidence is already available for reasoning. However, in complex 3D scenes, many failure cases arise not from weak prediction capacity, but from incomplete task-relevant evidence under fixed observations. To address this limitation, we reformulate fine-grained affordance reasoning as a sequential evidence acquisition process, where ambiguity is progressively reduced through complementary 3D geometric and 2D semantic evidence. Building on this formulation, we propose A3R, an agentic affordance reasoning framework that enables an MLLM-based policy to iteratively select evidence acquisition actions and update the affordance belief through cross-dimensional evidence acquisition. To optimize such sequential decision making, we further introduce a GRPO-based policy learning strategy that improves evidence acquisition efficiency and reasoning accuracy. Extensive experiments on scene-level benchmarks show that A3R consistently surpasses static one-shot baselines, demonstrating the advantage of agentic cross-dimensional evidence acquisition for fine-grained affordance reasoning in complex 3D Gaussian scenes.

  Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a dominating technique for image rendering and has quickly been adapted for the X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) reconstruction task. However, despite being on par or better than many of its predecessors, the benefits of GS are typically not substantial enough to motivate a transition from well-established reconstruction algorithms. This paper addresses the most significant remaining limitations of the GS-based approach by introducing FaCT-GS, a framework for fast and flexible CT reconstruction. Enabled by an in-depth optimization of the voxelization and rasterization pipelines, our new method is significantly faster than its predecessors and scales well with projection and output volume size. Furthermore, the improved voxelization enables rapid fitting of Gaussians to pre-existing volumes, which can serve as a prior for warm-starting the reconstruction, or simply as an alternative, compressed representation. FaCT-GS is over 4X faster than the State of the Art GS CT reconstruction on standard 512x512 projections, and over 13X faster on 2k projections.

  Volumetric video seeks to model dynamic scenes as temporally coherent 4D representations. While recent Gaussian-based approaches achieve impressive rendering fidelity, they primarily emphasize appearance but are largely agnostic to instance-level structure, limiting stable tracking and semantic reasoning in highly dynamic scenarios. In this paper, we present Director, a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that jointly models human performance, high-fidelity rendering, and instance-level semantics. Our key insight is that embedding instance-consistent semantics naturally complements 4D modeling, enabling more accurate scene decomposition while supporting robust dynamic scene understanding. To this end, we leverage temporally aligned instance masks and sentence embeddings derived from Multimodal Large Language Models to supervise the learnable semantic features of each Gaussian via two MLP decoders, enabling language-aligned 4D representations and enforcing identity consistency over time. To enhance temporal stability, we bridge 2D optical flow with 4D Gaussians and finetune their motions, yielding reliable initialization and reducing drift. For the training, we further introduce a geometry-aware SDF constraints, along with regularization terms that enforces surface continuity, enhancing temporal coherence in dynamic foreground modeling. Experiments demonstrate that Director achieves temporally coherent 4D reconstructions while simultaneously enabling instance segmentation and open-vocabulary querying.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  We present F3DGS, a federated 3D Gaussian Splatting framework for decentralized multi-agent 3D reconstruction. Existing 3DGS pipelines assume centralized access to all observations, which limits their applicability in distributed robotic settings where agents operate independently, and centralized data aggregation may be restricted. Directly extending centralized training to multi-agent systems introduces communication overhead and geometric inconsistency. F3DGS first constructs a shared geometric scaffold by registering locally merged LiDAR point clouds from multiple clients to initialize a global 3DGS model. During federated optimization, Gaussian positions are fixed to preserve geometric alignment, while each client updates only appearance-related attributes, including covariance, opacity, and spherical harmonic coefficients. The server aggregates these updates using visibility-aware aggregation, weighting each client's contribution by how frequently it observed each Gaussian, resolving the partial-observability challenge inherent to multi-agent exploration. To evaluate decentralized reconstruction, we collect a multi-sequence indoor dataset with synchronized LiDAR, RGB, and IMU measurements. Experiments show that F3DGS achieves reconstruction quality comparable to centralized training while enabling distributed optimization across agents. The dataset, development kit, and source code will be publicly released.

- **Satellite-Free Training for Drone-View Geo-Localization**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Drone-view geo-localization (DVGL) aims to determine the location of drones in GPS-denied environments by retrieving the corresponding geotagged satellite tile from a reference gallery given UAV observations of a location. In many existing formulations, these observations are represented by a single oblique UAV image. In contrast, our satellite-free setting is designed for multi-view UAV sequences, which are used to construct a geometry-normalized UAV-side location representation before cross-view retrieval. Existing approaches rely on satellite imagery during training, either through paired supervision or unsupervised alignment, which limits practical deployment when satellite data are unavailable or restricted. In this paper, we propose a satellite-free training (SFT) framework that converts drone imagery into cross-view compatible representations through three main stages: drone-side 3D scene reconstruction, geometry-based pseudo-orthophoto generation, and satellite-free feature aggregation for retrieval. Specifically, we first reconstruct dense 3D scenes from multi-view drone images using 3D Gaussian splatting and project the reconstructed geometry into pseudo-orthophotos via PCA-guided orthographic projection. This rendering stage operates directly on reconstructed scene geometry without requiring camera parameters at rendering time. Next, we refine these orthophotos with lightweight geometry-guided inpainting to obtain texture-complete drone-side views. Finally, we extract DINOv3 patch features from the generated orthophotos, learn a Fisher vector aggregation model solely from drone data, and reuse it at test time to encode satellite tiles for cross-view retrieval. Experimental results on University-1652 and SUES-200 show that our SFT framework substantially outperforms satellite-free generalization baselines and narrows the gap to methods trained with satellite imagery.

- **ColorGradedGaussians: Palette-Based Color Grading for 3D Gaussian Splatting via View-Space Sparse Decomposition**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Professional color editing requires precise control over both color (hue and saturation) and lightness, ideally through separate, independent controls. We present a real-time interactive color editing framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that enables palette-based recoloring, per-palette tone curves for color-aware lightness adjustment, and accurate pixel-level constraints -- capabilities unavailable in prior palette-based 3DGS methods. Existing approaches decompose colors at the primitive level, optimizing per-Gaussian palette weights before splatting. However, sparse primitive-level weights do not guarantee sparse pixel-level decompositions after alpha-blending, causing palette edits to affect unintended regions and degrading editing quality. We address this through view-space palette decomposition, splatting weights instead of colors to optimize the observable appearance of the scene. We introduce a geometric loss using inverse barycentric coordinates to enforce consistent sparsity patterns, ensuring similar colors share similar decompositions. Our approach achieves superior editing quality compared to primitive-space methods, enabling professional color grading workflows for 3DGS scenes with real-time interaction.

- **Better Rigs, Not Bigger Networks: A Body Model Ablation for Gaussian Avatars**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Recent 3D Gaussian splatting methods built atop SMPL achieve remarkable visual fidelity while continually increasing the complexity of the overall training architecture. We demonstrate that much of this complexity is unnecessary: by replacing SMPL with the Momentum Human Rig (MHR), estimated via SAM-3D-Body, a minimal pipeline with no learned deformations or pose-dependent corrections achieves the highest reported PSNR and competitive or superior LPIPS and SSIM on PeopleSnapshot and ZJU-MoCap. To disentangle pose estimation quality from body model representational capacity, we perform two controlled ablations: translating SAM-3D-Body meshes to SMPL-X, and translating the original dataset's SMPL poses into MHR both retrained under identical conditions. These ablations confirm that body model expressiveness has been a primary bottleneck in avatar reconstruction, with both mesh representational capacity and pose estimation quality contributing meaningfully to the full pipeline's gains.

- **LESV: Language Embedded Sparse Voxel Fusion for Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Recent advancements in open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding heavily rely on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to register vision-language features into 3D space. However, we identify two critical limitations in these approaches: the spatial ambiguity arising from unstructured, overlapping Gaussians which necessitates probabilistic feature registration, and the multi-level semantic ambiguity caused by pooling features over object-level masks, which dilutes fine-grained details. To address these challenges, we present a novel framework that leverages Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster) as a structured, disjoint geometry representation. By regularizing SVRaster with monocular depth and normal priors, we establish a stable geometric foundation. This enables a deterministic, confidence-aware feature registration process and suppresses the semantic bleeding artifact common in 3DGS. Furthermore, we resolve multi-level ambiguity by exploiting the emerging dense alignment properties of foundation model AM-RADIO, avoiding the computational overhead of hierarchical training methods. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on Open Vocabulary 3D Object Retrieval and Point Cloud Understanding benchmarks, particularly excelling on fine-grained queries where registration methods typically fail.

  We present TRACE, a mesh-guided 3DGS editing framework that achieves automated, high-fidelity scene transformation. By anchoring video diffusion with explicit 3D geometry, TRACE uniquely enables fine-grained, part-level manipulatio--such as local pose shifting or component replacemen--while preserving the structural integrity of the central subject, a capability largely absent in existing editing methods. Our approach comprises three key stages: (1) Multi-view 3D-Anchor Synthesis, which leverages a sparse-view editor trained on our MV-TRACE datase--the first multi-view consistent dataset dedicated to scene-coherent object addition and modificatio--to generate spatially consistent 3D-anchors; (2) Tangible Geometry Anchoring (TGA), which ensures precise spatial synchronization between inserted meshes and the 3DGS scene via two-phase registration; and (3) Contextual Video Masking (CVM), which integrates 3D projections into an autoregressive video pipeline to achieve temporally stable, physically-grounded rendering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TRACE consistently outperforms existing methods especially in editing versatility and structural integrity.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Primitive-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting have recently become the state-of-the-art for novel-view synthesis and related reconstruction tasks. Compared to neural fields, these representations are more flexible, adaptive, and scale better to large scenes. However, the limited expressivity of individual primitives makes modeling high-frequency detail challenging. We introduce Neural Harmonic Textures, a neural representation approach that anchors latent feature vectors on a virtual scaffold surrounding each primitive. These features are interpolated within the primitive at ray intersection points. Inspired by Fourier analysis, we apply periodic activations to the interpolated features, turning alpha blending into a weighted sum of harmonic components. The resulting signal is then decoded in a single deferred pass using a small neural network, significantly reducing computational cost. Neural Harmonic Textures yield state-of-the-art results in real-time novel view synthesis while bridging the gap between primitive- and neural-field-based reconstruction. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing primitive-based pipelines such as 3DGUT, Triangle Splatting, and 2DGS. We further demonstrate its generality with applications to 2D image fitting and semantic reconstruction.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) present two main directions: feed-forward models offer fast inference in sparse-view settings, while per-scene optimization yields high-quality renderings but is computationally expensive. To combine the benefits of both, we introduce Diff3R, a novel framework that explicitly bridges feed-forward prediction and test-time optimization. By incorporating a differentiable 3DGS optimization layer directly into the training loop, our network learns to predict an optimal initialization for test-time optimization rather than a conventional zero-shot result. To overcome the computational cost of backpropagating through the optimization steps, we propose computing gradients via the Implicit Function Theorem and a scalable, matrix-free PCG solver tailored for 3DGS optimization. Additionally, we incorporate a data-driven uncertainty model into the optimization process by adaptively controlling how much the parameters are allowed to change during optimization. This approach effectively mitigates overfitting in under-constrained regions and increases robustness against input outliers. Since our proposed optimization layer is model-agnostic, we show that it can be seamlessly integrated into existing feed-forward 3DGS architectures for both pose-given and pose-free methods, providing improvements for test-time optimization.

  Vision-based autonomous driving has gained much attention due to its low costs and excellent performance. Compared with dense BEV (Bird's Eye View) or sparse query models, Gaussian-centric method is a comprehensive yet sparse representation by describing scene with 3D semantic Gaussians. In this paper, we introduce DLWM, a novel paradigm with Dual Latent World Models specifically designed to enable holistic gaussian-centric pre-training in autonomous driving using two stages. In the first stage, DLWM predicts 3D Gaussians from queries by self-supervised reconstructing multi-view semantic and depth images. Equipped with fine-grained contextual features, in the second stage, two latent world models are trained separately for temporal feature learning, including Gaussian-flow-guided latent prediction for downstream occupancy perception and forecasting tasks, and ego-planning-guided latent prediction for motion planning. Extensive experiments in SurroundOcc and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that DLWM shows significant performance gains across Gaussian-centric 3D occupancy perception, 4D occupancy forecasting and motion planning tasks.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  A photorealistic and immersive human avatar experience demands capturing fine, person-specific details such as cloth and hair dynamics, subtle facial expressions, and characteristic motion patterns. Achieving this requires large, high-quality datasets, which often introduce ambiguities and spurious correlations when very similar poses correspond to different appearances. Models that fit these details during training can overfit and produce unstable, abrupt appearance changes for novel poses. We propose a 3D Gaussian Splatting avatar model with a spatial MLP backbone that is conditioned on both pose and an appearance latent. The latent is learned during training by an encoder, yielding a compact representation that improves reconstruction quality and helps disambiguate pose-driven renderings. At driving time, our predictor autoregressively infers the latent, producing temporally smooth appearance evolution and improved stability. Overall, our method delivers a robust and practical path to high-fidelity, stable avatar driving.

  Efficient multi-agent 3D mapping is essential for robotic teams operating in unknown environments, but dense representations hinder real-time exchange over constrained communication links. In multi-agent Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), systems typically rely on a centralized server to merge and optimize the local maps produced by individual agents. However, sharing these large map representations, particularly those generated by recent methods such as Gaussian Splatting, becomes a bottleneck in real-world scenarios with limited bandwidth. We present an improved multi-agent RGB-D Gaussian Splatting SLAM framework that reduces communication load while preserving map fidelity. First, we incorporate a compaction step into our SLAM system to remove redundant 3D Gaussians, without degrading the rendering quality. Second, our approach performs centralized loop closure computation without initial guess, operating in two modes: a pure rendered-depth mode that requires no data beyond the 3D Gaussians, and a camera-depth mode that includes lightweight depth images for improved registration accuracy and additional Gaussian pruning. Evaluation on both synthetic and real-world datasets shows up to 85-95\% reduction in transmitted data compared to state-of-the-art approaches in both modes, bringing 3D Gaussian multi-agent SLAM closer to practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled efficient 3D scene reconstruction from everyday images with real-time, high-fidelity rendering, greatly advancing VR/AR applications. Fisheye cameras, with their wider field of view (FOV), promise high-quality reconstructions from fewer inputs and have recently attracted much attention. However, since 3DGS relies on rasterization, most subsequent works involving fisheye camera inputs first undistort images before training, which introduces two problems: 1) Black borders at image edges cause information loss and negate the fisheye's large FOV advantage; 2) Undistortion's stretch-and-interpolate resampling spreads each pixel's value over a larger area, diluting detail density -- causes 3DGS overfitting these low-frequency zones, producing blur and floating artifacts. In this work, we integrate fisheye camera model into the original 3DGS framework, enabling native fisheye image input for training without preprocessing. Despite correct modeling, we observed that the reconstructed scenes still exhibit floaters at image edges: Distortion increases toward the periphery, and 3DGS's original per-iteration random-selecting-view optimization ignores the cross-view correlations of a Gaussian, leading to extreme shapes (e.g., oversized or elongated) that degrade reconstruction quality. To address this, we introduce a feature-overlap-driven cross-view joint optimization strategy that establishes consistent geometric and photometric constraints across views-a technique equally applicable to existing pinhole-camera-based pipelines. Our DirectFisheye-GS matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance on public datasets.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Recent 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) methods achieve impressive dynamic scene reconstruction but often rely on piecewise linear velocity approximations and short temporal windows. This disjointed modeling leads to severe temporal fragmentation, forcing primitives to be repeatedly eliminated and regenerated to track complex nonlinear dynamics. This makeshift approximation eliminates the long-term temporal identity of objects and causes an inevitable proliferation of Gaussians, hindering scalability to extended video sequences. To address this, we propose TRiGS, a novel 4D representation that utilizes unified, continuous geometric transformations. By integrating $SE(3)$ transformations, hierarchical Bezier residuals, and learnable local anchors, TRiGS models geometrically consistent rigid motions for individual primitives. This continuous formulation preserves temporal identity and effectively mitigates unbounded memory growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TRiGS achieves high fidelity rendering on standard benchmarks while uniquely scaling to extended video sequences (e.g., 600 to 1200 frames) without severe memory bottlenecks, significantly outperforming prior works in temporal stability.

  Gaussian Splatting is a powerful tool for reconstructing diffuse scenes, but it struggles to simultaneously model specular reflections and the appearance of objects behind semi-transparent surfaces. These specular reflections and transmittance are essential for realistic novel view synthesis, and existing methods do not properly incorporate the underlying physical processes to simulate them. To address this issue, we propose RT-GS, a unified framework that integrates a microfacet material model and ray tracing to jointly model specular reflection and transmittance in Gaussian Splatting. We accomplish this by using separate Gaussian primitives for reflections and transmittance, which allow modeling distant reflections and reconstructing objects behind transparent surfaces concurrently. We utilize a differentiable ray tracing framework to obtain the specular reflection and transmittance appearance. Our experiments demonstrate that our method successfully produces reflections and recovers objects behind transparent surfaces in complex environments, achieving significant qualitative improvements over prior methods where these specular light interactions are prominent.

  Auto-regressive frameworks for next-scale prediction of 2D images have demonstrated strong potential for producing diverse and sophisticated content by progressively refining a coarse input. However, extending this paradigm to 3D object generation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce auto-regressive Gaussian splatting (ARGS), a framework for making next-scale predictions in parallel for generation according to levels of detail. We propose a Gaussian simplification strategy and reverse the simplification to guide next-scale generation. Benefiting from the use of hierarchical trees, the generation process requires only \(\mathcal{O}(\log n)\) steps, where \(n\) is the number of points. Furthermore, we propose a tree-based transformer to predict the tree structure auto-regressively, allowing leaf nodes to attend to their internal ancestors to enhance structural consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively generates multi-scale Gaussian representations with controllable levels of detail, visual fidelity, and a manageable time consumption budget.
