  Synthesizing novel views from monocular videos of dynamic scenes remains a challenging problem. Scene-specific methods that optimize 4D representations with explicit motion priors often break down in highly dynamic regions where multi-view information is hard to exploit. Diffusion-based approaches that integrate camera control into large pre-trained models can produce visually plausible videos but frequently suffer from geometric inconsistencies across both static and dynamic areas. Both families of methods also require substantial computational resources. Building on the success of generalizable models for static novel view synthesis, we adapt the framework to dynamic inputs and propose a new model with two key components: (1) a recurrent loop that enables unbounded and asynchronous mapping between input and target videos and (2) an efficient use of plane sweeps over dynamic inputs to disentangle camera and scene motion, and achieve fine-grained, six-degrees-of-freedom camera controls. We train and evaluate our model on the UCSD dataset and on Kubric-4D-dyn, a new monocular dynamic dataset featuring longer, higher resolution sequences with more complex scene dynamics than existing alternatives. Our model outperforms four Gaussian Splatting-based scene-specific approaches, as well as two diffusion-based approaches in reconstructing fine-grained geometric details across both static and dynamic regions.

  Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (FF-3DGS) emerges as a fast and robust solution for sparse-view 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis (NVS). However, existing FF-3DGS methods are built on incorrect screen-space dilation filters, causing severe rendering artifacts when rendering at out-of-distribution sampling rates. We firstly propose an FF-3DGS model, called AA-Splat, to enable robust anti-aliased rendering at any resolution. AA-Splat utilizes an opacity-balanced band-limiting (OBBL) design, which combines two components: a 3D band-limiting post-filter integrates multi-view maximal frequency bounds into the feed-forward reconstruction pipeline, effectively band-limiting the resulting 3D scene representations and eliminating degenerate Gaussians; an Opacity Balancing (OB) to seamlessly integrate all pixel-aligned Gaussian primitives into the rendering process, compensating for the increased overlap between expanded Gaussian primitives. AA-Splat demonstrates drastic improvements with average 5.4$\sim$7.5dB PSNR gains on NVS performance over a state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline, DepthSplat, at all resolutions, between $4\times$ and $1/4\times$. Code will be made available.

  Realistic reconstruction of dynamic 4D scenes from monocular videos is essential for understanding the physical world. Despite recent progress in neural rendering, existing methods often struggle to recover accurate 3D geometry and temporally consistent motion in complex environments. To address these challenges, we propose MotionScale, a 4D Gaussian Splatting framework that scales efficiently to large scenes and extended sequences while maintaining high-fidelity structural and motion coherence. At the core of our approach is a scalable motion field parameterized by cluster-centric basis transformations that adaptively expand to capture diverse and evolving motion patterns. To ensure robust reconstruction over long durations, we introduce a progressive optimization strategy comprising two decoupled propagation stages: 1) A background extension stage that adapts to newly visible regions, refines camera poses, and explicitly models transient shadows; 2) A foreground propagation stage that enforces motion consistency through a specialized three-stage refinement process. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world benchmarks demonstrate that MotionScale significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and temporal stability.

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity reconstruction of scene geometry and appearance. Building on this capability, inserting external mesh objects into reconstructed 3DGS scenes enables interactive editing and content augmentation for immersive applications such as AR/VR, virtual staging, and digital content creation. However, achieving physically consistent lighting and shadows for mesh insertion remains challenging, as it requires accurate scene illumination estimation and multi-view consistent rendering. To address this challenge, we present LightHarmony3D, a novel framework for illumination-consistent mesh insertion in 3DGS scenes. Central to our approach is our proposed generative module that predicts a full 360° HDR environment map at the insertion location via a single forward pass. By leveraging generative priors instead of iterative optimization, our method efficiently captures dominant scene illumination and enables physically grounded shading and shadows for inserted meshes while maintaining multi-view coherence. Furthermore, we introduce the first dedicated benchmark for mesh insertion in 3DGS, providing a standardized evaluation framework for assessing lighting consistency and photorealism. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world reconstruction datasets demonstrate that LightHarmony3D achieves state-of-the-art realism and multi-view consistency.

  Visual relocalization is a fundamental task in the field of 3D computer vision, estimating a camera's pose when it revisits a previously known scene. While point-based hierarchical relocalization methods have shown strong scalability and efficiency, they are often limited by sparse image observations and weak feature matching. In this work, we propose SplatHLoc, a novel hierarchical visual relocalization framework that uses Feature Gaussian Splatting as the scene representation. To address the sparsity of database images, we propose an adaptive viewpoint retrieval method that synthesizes virtual candidates with viewpoints more closely aligned with the query, thereby improving the accuracy of initial pose estimation. For feature matching, we observe that Gaussian-rendered features and those extracted directly from images exhibit different strengths across the two-stage matching process: the former performs better in the coarse stage, while the latter proves more effective in the fine stage. Therefore, we introduce a hybrid feature matching strategy, enabling more accurate and efficient pose estimation. Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets show that SplatHLoc enhances the robustness of visual relocalization, setting a new state-of-the-art.

  Novel view synthesis (NVS) in ultrasound has gained attention as a technique for generating anatomically plausible views beyond the acquired frames, offering new capabilities for training clinicians or data augmentation. However, current methods struggle with complex tissue and view-dependent acoustic effects. Physics-based NVS aims to address these limitations by including the ultrasound image formation process into the simulation. Recent approaches combine a learnable implicit scene representation with an ultrasound-specific rendering module, yet a substantial gap between simulation and reality remains. In this work, we introduce UltraG-Ray, a novel ultrasound scene representation based on a learnable 3D Gaussian field, coupled to an efficient physics-based module for B-mode synthesis. We explicitly encode ultrasound-specific parameters, such as attenuation and reflection, into a Gaussian-based spatial representation and realize image synthesis within a novel ray casting scheme. In contrast to previous methods, this approach naturally captures view-dependent attenuation effects, thereby enabling the generation of physically informed B-mode images with increased realism. We compare our method to state-of-the-art and observe consistent gains in image quality metrics (up to 15% increase on MS-SSIM), demonstrating clear improvement in terms of realism of the synthesized ultrasound images.

  Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, its prohibitive storage overhead severely hinders practical deployment. Recent anchor-based 3DGS compression schemes reduce gaussina redundancy through ome advanced context models. However, overlook explicit geometric dependencies, leading to structural degradation and suboptimal rate-distortion performance. In this paper, we propose LG-HCC, a geometry-aware 3DGS compression framework that incorporates inter-anchor geometric correlations into anchor pruning and entropy coding for compact representation. Specifically, we introduce an Neighborhood-Aware Anchor Pruning (NAAP) strategy, which evaluates anchor importance via weighted neighborhood feature aggregation and merges redundant anchors into salient neighbors, yielding a compact yet geometry-consistent anchor set. Building upon this optimized structure, we further develop a hierarchical entropy coding scheme, in which coarse-to-fine priors are exploited through a lightweight Geometry-Guided Convolution (GG-Conv) operator to enable spatially adaptive context modeling and rate-distortion optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LG-HCC effectively resolves the structure preservation bottleneck, maintaining superior geometric integrity and rendering fidelity over state-of-the-art anchor-based compression approaches.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Achieving precise, object-level control in image editing remains challenging: 2D methods lack 3D awareness and often yield ambiguous or implausible results, while existing 3D-aware approaches rely on heavy optimization or incomplete monocular reconstructions. We present ObjectMorpher, a unified, interactive framework that converts ambiguous 2D edits into geometry-grounded operations. ObjectMorpher lifts target instances with an image-to-3D generator into editable 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), enabling fast, identity-preserving manipulation. Users drag control points; a graph-based non-rigid deformation with as-rigid-as-possible (ARAP) constraints ensures physically sensible shape and pose changes. A composite diffusion module harmonizes lighting, color, and boundaries for seamless reintegration. Across diverse categories, ObjectMorpher delivers fine-grained, photorealistic edits with superior controllability and efficiency, outperforming 2D drag and 3D-aware baselines on KID, LPIPS, SIFID, and user preference.

  Text-driven 3D scene editing has attracted considerable interest due to its convenience and user-friendliness. However, methods that rely on implicit 3D representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), while effective in rendering complex scenes, are hindered by slow processing speeds and limited control over specific regions of the scene. Moreover, existing approaches, including Instruct-NeRF2NeRF and GaussianEditor, which utilize multi-view editing strategies, frequently produce inconsistent results across different views when executing text instructions. This inconsistency can adversely affect the overall performance of the model, complicating the task of balancing the consistency of editing results with editing efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method termed Single-View to 3D Object Editing via Gaussian Splatting (SVGS), which is a single-view text-driven editing technique based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Specifically, in response to text instructions, we introduce a single-view editing strategy grounded in multi-view diffusion models, which reconstructs 3D scenes by leveraging only those views that yield consistent editing results. Additionally, we employ sparse 3D Gaussian Splatting as the 3D representation, which significantly enhances editing efficiency. We conducted a comparative analysis of SVGS against existing baseline methods across various scene settings, and the results indicate that SVGS outperforms its counterparts in both editing capability and processing speed, representing a significant advancement in 3D editing technology.

- **\textit{4DSurf}: High-Fidelity Dynamic Scene Surface Reconstruction**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  This paper addresses the problem of dynamic scene surface reconstruction using Gaussian Splatting (GS), aiming to recover temporally consistent geometry. While existing GS-based dynamic surface reconstruction methods can yield superior reconstruction, they are typically limited to either a single object or objects with only small deformations, struggling to maintain temporally consistent surface reconstruction of large deformations over time. We propose ``\textit{4DSurf}'', a novel and unified framework for generic dynamic surface reconstruction that does not require specifying the number or types of objects in the scene, can handle large surface deformations and temporal inconsistency in reconstruction. The key innovation of our framework is the introduction of Gaussian deformations induced Signed Distance Function Flow Regularization that constrains the motion of Gaussians to align with the evolving surface. To handle large deformations, we introduce an Overlapping Segment Partitioning strategy that divides the sequence into overlapping segments with small deformations and incrementally passes geometric information across segments through the shared overlapping timestep. Experiments on two challenging dynamic scene datasets, Hi4D and CMU Panoptic, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods by 49\% and 19\% in Chamfer distance, respectively, and achieves superior temporal consistency under sparse-view settings.

- **Physically Inspired Gaussian Splatting for HDR Novel View Synthesis**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  High dynamic range novel view synthesis (HDR-NVS) reconstructs scenes with dynamic details by fusing multi-exposure low dynamic range (LDR) views, yet it struggles to capture ambient illumination-dependent appearance. Implicitly supervising HDR content by constraining tone-mapped results fails in correcting abnormal HDR values, and results in limited gradients for Gaussians in under/over-exposed regions. To this end, we introduce PhysHDR-GS, a physically inspired HDR-NVS framework that models scene appearance via intrinsic reflectance and adjustable ambient illumination. PhysHDR-GS employs a complementary image-exposure (IE) branch and Gaussian-illumination (GI) branch to faithfully reproduce standard camera observations and capture illumination-dependent appearance changes, respectively. During training, the proposed cross-branch HDR consistency loss provides explicit supervision for HDR content, while an illumination-guided gradient scaling strategy mitigates exposure-biased gradient starvation and reduces under-densified representations. Experimental results across realistic and synthetic datasets demonstrate our superiority in reconstructing HDR details (e.g., a PSNR gain of 2.04 dB over HDR-GS), while maintaining real-time rendering speed (up to 76 FPS). Code and models are available at https://huimin-zeng.github.io/PhysHDR-GS/.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  While recent 3D head avatar creation methods attempt to animate facial dynamics, they often fail to capture personalized details, limiting realism and expressiveness. To fill this gap, we present DipGuava (Disentangled and Personalized Gaussian UV Avatar), a novel 3D Gaussian head avatar creation method that successfully generates avatars with personalized attributes from monocular video. DipGuava is the first method to explicitly disentangle facial appearance into two complementary components, trained in a structured two-stage pipeline that significantly reduces learning ambiguity and enhances reconstruction fidelity. In the first stage, we learn a stable geometry-driven base appearance that captures global facial structure and coarse expression-dependent variations. In the second stage, the personalized residual details not captured in the first stage are predicted, including high-frequency components and nonlinearly varying features such as wrinkles and subtle skin deformations. These components are fused via dynamic appearance fusion that integrates residual details after deformation, ensuring spatial and semantic alignment. This disentangled design enables DipGuava to generate photorealistic, identity-preserving avatars, consistently outperforming prior methods in both visual quality and quantitativeperformance, as demonstrated in extensive experiments.

  Recently, the multi-modal fusion of RGB, depth, and semantics has shown great potential in dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). However, a prerequisite for generating consistent semantic maps is the availability of dense, efficient, and scalable scene representations. Existing semantic SLAM systems based on explicit representations are often limited by resolution and an inability to predict unknown areas. Conversely, implicit representations typically rely on time-consuming ray tracing, failing to meet real-time requirements. Fortunately, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising representation that combines the efficiency of point-based methods with the continuity of geometric structures. To this end, we propose GS3LAM, a Gaussian Semantic Splatting SLAM framework that processes multimodal data to render consistent, dense semantic maps in real-time. GS3LAM models the scene as a Semantic Gaussian Field (SG-Field) and jointly optimizes camera poses and the field via multimodal error constraints. Furthermore, a Depth-adaptive Scale Regularization (DSR) scheme is introduced to resolve misalignments between scale-invariant Gaussians and geometric surfaces. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we propose a Random Sampling-based Keyframe Mapping (RSKM) strategy, which demonstrates superior performance over common local covisibility optimization methods. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that GS3LAM achieves increased tracking robustness, superior rendering quality, and enhanced semantic precision compared to state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at https://github.com/lif314/GS3LAM.
