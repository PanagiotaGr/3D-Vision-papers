  We propose a novel framework for diffusion-based novel view synthesis in which we leverage external representations as conditions, harnessing their geometric and semantic correspondence properties for enhanced geometric consistency in generated novel viewpoints. First, we provide a detailed analysis exploring the correspondence capabilities emergent in the spatial attention of external visual representations. Building from these insights, we propose a representation-guided novel view synthesis through dedicated representation projection modules that inject external representations into the diffusion process, a methodology named ReNoV, short for representation-guided novel view synthesis. Our experiments show that this design yields marked improvements in both reconstruction fidelity and inpainting quality, outperforming prior diffusion-based novel-view methods on standard benchmarks and enabling robust synthesis from sparse, unposed image collections.

  Interfacial dynamics in two-phase flows govern momentum, heat, and mass transfer, yet remain difficult to measure experimentally. Classical techniques face intrinsic limitations near moving interfaces, while existing neural rendering methods target single-phase flows with diffuse boundaries and cannot handle sharp, deformable liquid-vapor interfaces. We propose SurfPhase, a novel model for reconstructing 3D interfacial dynamics from sparse camera views. Our approach integrates dynamic Gaussian surfels with a signed distance function formulation for geometric consistency, and leverages a video diffusion model to synthesize novel-view videos to refine reconstruction from sparse observations. We evaluate on a new dataset of high-speed pool boiling videos, demonstrating high-quality view synthesis and velocity estimation from only two camera views.
