  High-quality 3D streaming from multiple cameras is crucial for immersive experiences in many AR/VR applications. The limited number of views - often due to real-time constraints - leads to missing information and incomplete surfaces in the rendered images. Existing approaches typically rely on simple heuristics for the hole filling, which can result in inconsistencies or visual artifacts. We propose to complete the missing textures using a novel, application-targeted inpainting method independent of the underlying representation as an image-based post-processing step after the novel view rendering. The method is designed as a standalone module compatible with any calibrated multi-camera system. For this we introduce a multi-view aware, transformer-based network architecture using spatio-temporal embeddings to ensure consistency across frames while preserving fine details. Additionally, our resolution-independent design allows adaptation to different camera setups, while an adaptive patch selection strategy balances inference speed and quality, allowing real-time performance. We evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art inpainting techniques under the same real-time constraints and demonstrate that our model achieves the best trade-off between quality and speed, outperforming competitors in both image and video-based metrics.

  We introduce Dark3R, a framework for structure from motion in the dark that operates directly on raw images with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) below $-4$ dB -- a regime where conventional feature- and learning-based methods break down. Our key insight is to adapt large-scale 3D foundation models to extreme low-light conditions through a teacher--student distillation process, enabling robust feature matching and camera pose estimation in low light. Dark3R requires no 3D supervision; it is trained solely on noisy--clean raw image pairs, which can be either captured directly or synthesized using a simple Poisson--Gaussian noise model applied to well-exposed raw images. To train and evaluate our approach, we introduce a new, exposure-bracketed dataset that includes $\sim$42,000 multi-view raw images with ground-truth 3D annotations, and we demonstrate that Dark3R achieves state-of-the-art structure from motion in the low-SNR regime. Further, we demonstrate state-of-the-art novel view synthesis in the dark using Dark3R's predicted poses and a coarse-to-fine radiance field optimization procedure.

- **SSR-GS: Separating Specular Reflection in Gaussian Splatting for Glossy Surface Reconstruction**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  In recent years, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has achieved remarkable progress in novel view synthesis. However, accurately reconstructing glossy surfaces under complex illumination remains challenging, particularly in scenes with strong specular reflections and multi-surface interreflections. To address this issue, we propose SSR-GS, a specular reflection modeling framework for glossy surface reconstruction. Specifically, we introduce a prefiltered Mip-Cubemap to model direct specular reflections efficiently, and propose an IndiASG module to capture indirect specular reflections. Furthermore, we design Visual Geometry Priors (VGP) that couple a reflection-aware visual prior via a reflection score (RS) to downweight the photometric loss contribution of reflection-dominated regions, with geometry priors derived from VGGT, including progressively decayed depth supervision and transformed normal constraints. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SSR-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance in glossy surface reconstruction.

- **Beyond the Patch: Exploring Vulnerabilities of Visuomotor Policies via Viewpoint-Consistent 3D Adversarial Object**  
  Chanmi Lee, Minsung Yoon, Woojae Kim, Sebin Lee, Sung-eui Yoon

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Neural network-based visuomotor policies enable robots to perform manipulation tasks but remain susceptible to perceptual attacks. For example, conventional 2D adversarial patches are effective under fixed-camera setups, where appearance is relatively consistent; however, their efficacy often diminishes under dynamic viewpoints from moving cameras, such as wrist-mounted setups, due to perspective distortions. To proactively investigate potential vulnerabilities beyond 2D patches, this work proposes a viewpoint-consistent adversarial texture optimization method for 3D objects through differentiable rendering. As optimization strategies, we employ Expectation over Transformation (EOT) with a Coarse-to-Fine (C2F) curriculum, exploiting distance-dependent frequency characteristics to induce textures effective across varying camera-object distances. We further integrate saliency-guided perturbations to redirect policy attention and design a targeted loss that persistently drives robots toward adversarial objects. Our comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method is effective under various environmental conditions, while confirming its black-box transferability and real-world applicability.

- **GloSplat: Joint Pose-Appearance Optimization for Faster and More Accurate 3D Reconstruction**  
  Tianyu Xiong, Rui Li, Linjie Li, Jiaqi Yang  
  _2026-03-05_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.04847v1  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Feature extraction, matching, structure from motion (SfM), and novel view synthesis (NVS) have traditionally been treated as separate problems with independent optimization objectives. We present GloSplat, a framework that performs \emph{joint pose-appearance optimization} during 3D Gaussian Splatting training. Unlike prior joint optimization methods (BARF, NeRF--, 3RGS) that rely purely on photometric gradients for pose refinement, GloSplat preserves \emph{explicit SfM feature tracks} as first-class entities throughout training: track 3D points are maintained as separate optimizable parameters from Gaussian primitives, providing persistent geometric anchors via a reprojection loss that operates alongside photometric supervision. This architectural choice prevents early-stage pose drift while enabling fine-grained refinement -- a capability absent in photometric-only approaches. We introduce two pipeline variants: (1) \textbf{GloSplat-F}, a COLMAP-free variant using retrieval-based pair selection for efficient reconstruction, and (2) \textbf{GloSplat-A}, an exhaustive matching variant for maximum quality. Both employ global SfM initialization followed by joint photometric-geometric optimization during 3DGS training. Experiments demonstrate that GloSplat-F achieves state-of-the-art among COLMAP-free methods while GloSplat-A surpasses all COLMAP-based baselines.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  We present \textbf{BLOCK}, an open-source bi-stage character-to-skin pipeline that generates pixel-perfect Minecraft skins from arbitrary character concepts. BLOCK decomposes the problem into (i) a \textbf{3D preview synthesis stage} driven by a large multimodal model (MLLM) with a carefully designed prompt-and-reference template, producing a consistent dual-panel (front/back) oblique-view Minecraft-style preview; and (ii) a \textbf{skin decoding stage} based on a fine-tuned FLUX.2 model that translates the preview into a skin atlas image. We further propose \textbf{EvolveLoRA}, a progressive LoRA curriculum (text-to-image $\rightarrow$ image-to-image $\rightarrow$ preview-to-skin) that initializes each phase from the previous adapter to improve stability and efficiency. BLOCK is released with all prompt templates and fine-tuned weights to support reproducible character-to-skin generation.
