- **ReCoSplat: Autoregressive Feed-Forward Gaussian Splatting Using Render-and-Compare**

  Online novel view synthesis remains challenging, requiring robust scene reconstruction from sequential, often unposed, observations. We present ReCoSplat, an autoregressive feed-forward Gaussian Splatting model supporting posed or unposed inputs, with or without camera intrinsics. While assembling local Gaussians using camera poses scales better than canonical-space prediction, it creates a dilemma during training: using ground-truth poses ensures stability but causes a distribution mismatch when predicted poses are used at inference. To address this, we introduce a Render-and-Compare (ReCo) module. ReCo renders the current reconstruction from the predicted viewpoint and compares it with the incoming observation, providing a stable conditioning signal that compensates for pose errors. To support long sequences, we propose a hybrid KV cache compression strategy combining early-layer truncation with chunk-level selective retention, reducing the KV cache size by over 90% for 100+ frames. ReCoSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance across different input settings on both in- and out-of-distribution benchmarks. Code and pretrained models will be released.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  We address the challenge of novel view synthesis from only two input images under large viewpoint changes. Existing regression-based methods lack the capacity to reconstruct unseen regions, while camera-guided diffusion models often deviate from intended trajectories due to noisy point cloud projections or insufficient conditioning from camera poses. To address these issues, we propose ConfCtrl, a confidence-aware video interpolation framework that enables diffusion models to follow prescribed camera poses while completing unseen regions. ConfCtrl initializes the diffusion process by combining a confidence-weighted projected point cloud latent with noise as the conditioning input. It then applies a Kalman-inspired predict-update mechanism, treating the projected point cloud as a noisy measurement and using learned residual corrections to balance pose-driven predictions with noisy geometric observations. This allows the model to rely on reliable projections while down-weighting uncertain regions, yielding stable, geometry-aware generation. Experiments on multiple datasets show that ConfCtrl produces geometrically consistent and visually plausible novel views, effectively reconstructing occluded regions under large viewpoint changes.

  Recently, the 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) technique for real-time radiance field rendering has revolutionized the field of volumetric scene representation, providing users with an immersive experience. But in return, it also poses a large amount of data volume, which is extremely bandwidth-intensive. Cutting-edge researchers have tried to introduce different approaches and construct multiple variants for 3DGS to obtain a more compact scene representation, but it is still challenging for real-time distribution. In this paper, we propose GSStream, a novel volumetric scene streaming system to support 3DGS data format. Specifically, GSStream integrates a collaborative viewport prediction module to better predict users' future behaviors by learning collaborative priors and historical priors from multiple users and users' viewport sequences and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based bitrate adaptation module to tackle the state and action space variability challenge of the bitrate adaptation problem, achieving efficient volumetric scene delivery. Besides, we first build a user viewport trajectory dataset for volumetric scenes to support the training and streaming simulation. Extensive experiments prove that our proposed GSStream system outperforms existing representative volumetric scene streaming systems in visual quality and network usage.

- **VarSplat: Uncertainty-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting for Robust RGB-D SLAM**

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables fast, differentiable rendering and high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse real-world scenes. However, existing 3DGS-SLAM approaches handle measurement reliability implicitly, making pose estimation and global alignment susceptible to drift in low-texture regions, transparent surfaces, or areas with complex reflectance properties. To this end, we introduce VarSplat, an uncertainty-aware 3DGS-SLAM system that explicitly learns per-splat appearance variance. By using the law of total variance with alpha compositing, we then render differentiable per-pixel uncertainty map via efficient, single-pass rasterization. This map guides tracking, submap registration, and loop detection toward focusing on reliable regions and contributes to more stable optimization. Experimental results on Replica (synthetic) and TUM-RGBD, ScanNet, and ScanNet++ (real-world) show that VarSplat improves robustness and achieves competitive or superior tracking, mapping, and novel view synthesis rendering compared to existing studies for dense RGB-D SLAM.

- **X-GS: An Extensible Open Framework Unifying 3DGS Architectures with Downstream Multimodal Models**  
  Yueen Ma, Irwin King

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for novel view synthesis, subsequently extending into numerous spatial AI applications. However, most existing 3DGS methods are isolated, focusing on specific domains such as online SLAM, semantic enrichment, or 3DGS for unposed images. In this paper, we introduce X-GS, an extensible open framework that unifies a broad range of techniques to enable real-time 3DGS-based online SLAM enriched with semantics, bridging the gap to downstream multimodal models. At the core of X-GS is a highly efficient pipeline called X-GS-Perceiver, capable of taking unposed RGB (or optionally RGB-D) video streams as input to co-optimize geometry and poses, and distill high-dimensional semantic features from vision foundation models into the 3D Gaussians. We achieve real-time performance through a novel online Vector Quantization (VQ) module, a GPU-accelerated grid-sampling scheme, and a highly parallelized pipeline design. The semantic 3D Gaussians can then be utilized by vision-language models within the X-GS-Thinker component, enabling downstream tasks such as object detection, zero-shot caption generation, and potentially embodied tasks. Experimental results on real-world datasets showcase the efficacy, efficiency, and newly unlocked multimodal capabilities of the X-GS framework.

- **Physics-Driven 3D Gaussian Rendering for Zero-Shot MRI Super-Resolution**  
  Shuting Liu, Lei Zhang, Wei Huang, Zhao Zhang, Zizhou Wang

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  High-resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is vital for clinical diagnosis but limited by long acquisition times and motion artifacts. Super-resolution (SR) reconstructs low-resolution scans into high-resolution images, yet existing methods are mutually constrained: paired-data methods achieve efficiency only by relying on costly aligned datasets, while implicit neural representation approaches avoid such data needs at the expense of heavy computation. We propose a zero-shot MRI SR framework using explicit Gaussian representation to balance data requirements and efficiency. MRI-tailored Gaussian parameters embed tissue physical properties, reducing learnable parameters while preserving MR signal fidelity. A physics-grounded volume rendering strategy models MRI signal formation via normalized Gaussian aggregation. Additionally, a brick-based order-independent rasterization scheme enables highly parallel 3D computation, lowering training and inference costs. Experiments on two public MRI datasets show superior reconstruction quality and efficiency, demonstrating the method's potential for clinical MRI SR.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  3D scene reconstruction and novel-view synthesis are fundamental for VR, robotics, and content creation. However, most NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting pipelines assume clean inputs and degrade under real noise and artifacts. We therefore propose DenoiseSplat, a feed-forward 3D Gaussian splatting method for noisy multi-view images. We build a large-scale, scene-consistent noisy--clean benchmark on RE10K by injecting Gaussian, Poisson, speckle, and salt-and-pepper noise with controlled intensities. With a lightweight MVSplat-style feed-forward backbone, we train end-to-end using only clean 2D renderings as supervision and no 3D ground truth. On noisy RE10K, DenoiseSplat outperforms vanilla MVSplat and a strong two-stage baseline (IDF + MVSplat) in PSNR/SSIM and LPIPS across noise types and levels.

- **Speeding Up the Learning of 3D Gaussians with Much Shorter Gaussian Lists**  
  Jiaqi Liu, Zhizhong Han

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has become a vital tool for learning a radiance field from multiple posed images. Although 3DGS shows great advantages over NeRF in terms of rendering quality and efficiency, it remains a research challenge to further improve the efficiency of learning 3D Gaussians. To overcome this challenge, we propose novel training strategies and losses to shorten each Gaussian list used to render a pixel, which speeds up the splatting by involving fewer Gaussians along a ray. Specifically, we shrink the size of each Gaussian by resetting their scales regularly, encouraging smaller Gaussians to cover fewer nearby pixels, which shortens the Gaussian lists of pixels. Additionally, we introduce an entropy constraint on the alpha blending procedure to sharpen the weight distribution of Gaussians along each ray, which drives dominant weights larger while making minor weights smaller. As a result, each Gaussian becomes more focused on the pixels where it is dominant, which reduces its impact on nearby pixels, leading to even shorter Gaussian lists. Eventually, we integrate our method into a rendering resolution scheduler which further improves efficiency through progressive resolution increase. We evaluate our method by comparing it with state-of-the-art methods on widely used benchmarks. Our results show significant advantages over others in efficiency without sacrificing rendering quality.

- **SkipGS: Post-Densification Backward Skipping for Efficient 3DGS Training**  
  Jingxing Li, Yongjae Leeand, Deliang Fan  
  _2026-03-09_ · https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.08997v1  
  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time novel-view synthesis by optimizing millions of anisotropic Gaussians, yet its training remains expensive, with the backward pass dominating runtime in the post-densification refinement phase. We observe substantial update redundancy in this phase: many sampled views have near-plateaued losses and provide diminishing gradient benefits, but standard training still runs full backpropagation. We propose SkipGS with a novel view-adaptive backward gating mechanism for efficient post-densification training. SkipGS always performs the forward pass to update per-view loss statistics, and selectively skips backward passes when the sampled view's loss is consistent with its recent per-view baseline, while enforcing a minimum backward budget for stable optimization. On Mip-NeRF 360, compared to 3DGS, SkipGS reduces end-to-end training time by 23.1%, driven by a 42.0% reduction in post-densification time, with comparable reconstruction quality. Because it only changes when to backpropagate -- without modifying the renderer, representation, or loss -- SkipGS is plug-and-play and compatible with other complementary efficiency strategies for additive speedups.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shifted the focus toward balancing reconstruction fidelity with computational efficiency. In this work, we propose ImprovedGS+, a high-performance, low-level reinvention of the ImprovedGS strategy, implemented natively within the LichtFeld-Studio framework. By transitioning from high-level Python logic to hardware-optimized C++/CUDA kernels, we achieve a significant reduction in host-device synchronization and training latency. Our implementation introduces a Long-Axis-Split (LAS) CUDA kernel, custom Laplacian-based importance kernels with Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) for edge scores, and an adaptive Exponential Scale Scheduler. Experimental results on the Mip-NeRF360 dataset demonstrate that ImprovedGS+ establishes a new Pareto-optimal front for scene reconstruction. Our 1M-budget variant outperforms the state-of-the-art MCMC baseline by achieving a 26.8% reduction in training time (saving 17 minutes per session) and utilizing 13.3% fewer Gaussians while maintaining superior visual quality. Furthermore, our full variant demonstrates a 1.28 dB PSNR increase over the ADC baseline with a 38.4% reduction in parametric complexity. These results validate ImprovedGS+ as a scalable, high-speed solution that upholds the core pillars of Speed, Quality, and Usability within the LichtFeld-Studio ecosystem.

  <details><summary>Abstract</summary>

  Novel view synthesis (NVS) is increasingly relevant for edge robotics, where compact and incrementally updatable 3D scene models are needed for SLAM, navigation, and inspection under tight memory and latency budgets. Variational Bayesian Gaussian Splatting (VBGS) enables replay-free continual updates for the 3DGS algorithm by maintaining a probabilistic scene model, but its high-precision computations and large intermediate tensors make on-device training impractical. We present a precision-adaptive optimization framework that enables VBGS training on resource-constrained hardware without altering its variational formulation. We (i) profile VBGS to identify memory/latency hotspots, (ii) fuse memory-dominant kernels to reduce materialized intermediate tensors, and (iii) automatically assign operation-level precisions via a mixed-precision search with bounded relative error. Across the Blender, Habitat, and Replica datasets, our optimised pipeline reduces peak memory from 9.44 GB to 1.11 GB and training time from ~234 min to ~61 min on an A5000 GPU, while preserving (and in some cases improving) reconstruction quality of the state-of-the-art VBGS baseline. We also enable for the first time NVS training on a commercial embedded platform, the Jetson Orin Nano, reducing per-frame latency by 19x compared to 3DGS.

  Radiance of real-world scenes typically spans a much wider dynamic range than what standard cameras can capture. While conventional HDR methods merge alternating-exposure frames, these approaches are inherently constrained to 2D pixel-level alignment, often leading to ghosting artifacts and temporal inconsistency in dynamic scenes. To address these limitations, we present HDR-NSFF, a paradigm shift from 2D-based merging to 4D spatio-temporal modeling. Our framework reconstructs dynamic HDR radiance fields from alternating-exposure monocular videos by representing the scene as a continuous function of space and time, and is compatible with both neural radiance field and 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) based dynamic representations. This unified end-to-end pipeline explicitly models HDR radiance, 3D scene flow, geometry, and tone-mapping, ensuring physical plausibility and global coherence. We further enhance robustness by (i) extending semantic-based optical flow with DINO features to achieve exposure-invariant motion estimation, and (ii) incorporating a generative prior as a regularizer to compensate for limited observation in monocular captures and saturation-induced information loss. To evaluate HDR space-time view synthesis, we present the first real-world HDR-GoPro dataset specifically designed for dynamic HDR scenes. Experiments demonstrate that HDR-NSFF recovers fine radiance details and coherent dynamics even under challenging exposure variations, thereby achieving state-of-the-art performance in novel space-time view synthesis.

  Accurate 3D reconstruction of vertebral anatomy from ultrasound is important for guiding minimally invasive spine interventions, but it remains challenging due to acoustic shadowing and view-dependent signal variations. We propose an occupancy-based shape completion method that reconstructs complete 3D anatomical geometry from partial ultrasound observations. Crucially for intra-operative applications, our approach extracts the anatomical surface directly from the image, avoiding the need for anatomical labels during inference. This label-free completion relies on a coupled latent space representing both the image appearance and the underlying anatomical shape. By leveraging a Neural Implicit Representation (NIR) that jointly models both spatial occupancy and acoustic interactions, the method uses acoustic parameters to become implicitly aware of the unseen regions without explicit shadowing labels through tracking acoustic signal transmission. We show that this method outperforms state-of-the-art shape completion for B-mode ultrasound by 80% in HD95 score. We validate our approach both in-silico and on phantom US images with registered mesh models from CT labels, demonstrating accurate reconstruction of occluded anatomy and robust generalization across diverse imaging conditions. Code and data will be released on publication.

  Existing 4D human datasets fall short for fashion-specific research, lacking either realistic garment dynamics or task-specific annotations. Synthetic datasets suffer from a realism gap, whereas real-world captures lack the detailed annotations and paired data required for virtual try-on (VTON) and size estimation tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce MV-Fashion, a large-scale, multi-view video dataset engineered for domain-specific fashion analysis. MV-Fashion features 3,273 sequences (72.5 million frames) from 80 diverse subjects wearing 3-10 outfits each. It is designed to capture complex, real-world garment dynamics, including multiple layers and varied styling (e.g. rolled sleeves, tucked shirt). A core contribution is a rich data representation that includes pixel-level semantic annotations, ground-truth material properties like elasticity, and 3D point clouds. Crucially for VTON applications, MV-Fashion provides paired data: multi-view synchronized captures of worn garments alongside their corresponding flat, catalogue images. We leverage this dataset to establish baselines for fashion-centric tasks, including virtual try-on, clothing size estimation, and novel view synthesis. The dataset is available at https://hunorlaczko.github.io/MV-Fashion .

  Novel view synthesis from low-light, noisy, and motion-blurred imagery remains a valuable and challenging task. Current volumetric rendering methods struggle with compound degradation, and sequential 2D preprocessing introduces artifacts due to interdependencies. In this work, we introduce FLED-GS, a fast low-light enhancement and deblurring framework that reformulates 3D scene restoration as an alternating cycle of enhancement and reconstruction. Specifically, FLED-GS inserts several intermediate brightness anchors to enable progressive recovery, preventing noise blow-up from harming deblurring or geometry. Each iteration sharpens inputs with an off-the-shelf 2D deblurrer and then performs noise-aware 3DGS reconstruction that estimates and suppresses noise while producing clean priors for the next level. Experiments show FLED-GS outperforms state-of-the-art LuSh-NeRF, achieving 21$\times$ faster training and 11$\times$ faster rendering.
