- Point Clouds & 3D Representations
- 3D Scene Understanding
- Perception for Robotics & Autonomous Systems

---

## How it works

- Papers are retrieved from **arXiv** using the official API
- Queries are defined per topic using domain-specific keywords
- Results are filtered by:
  - publication date
  - keyword blacklist
  - cross-topic deduplication
- Markdown pages are generated automatically
- Updates run daily via **GitHub Actions**

---

## Motivation

3D Computer Vision is a fast-moving research field with high publication volume.  
This repository provides a **reproducible, automated, and topic-structured** way to track recent work without manual searching.

It is suitable for:
- Diploma / Master theses
- PhD-level research
- Early-stage literature exploration
- Continuous SOTA tracking

---

## Automation

Updates are triggered automatically using GitHub Actions.  
To enable publishing:

1. Go to **Settings → Pages**
2. Select branch: `main`
3. Folder: `/docs`
