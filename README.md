# 3D Vision Papers – Automated arXiv Digest

Daily arXiv digest focused on **3D Computer Vision** research, including geometry-aware perception, reconstruction, and scene understanding.

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED:START -->
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED:END -->

This repository is designed to support:

- literature review
- dataset discovery
- continuous state-of-the-art monitoring
- thesis and research work in 3D Vision

---

## Scope

- 3D Reconstruction & Multi-view Geometry  
- Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)
- Depth & Pose Estimation
- SLAM & Visual Odometry
- Point Clouds & 3D Representations
- 3D Scene Understanding
- Perception for Robotics & Autonomous Systems

---

## How it works

- Papers are retrieved from **arXiv** using the official API
- Queries are defined per topic using domain-specific keywords
- Results are filtered by:
  - publication date
  - keyword blacklist
  - cross-topic deduplication
- Markdown pages are generated automatically
- Updates run daily via **GitHub Actions**

---

## Motivation

3D Computer Vision is a fast-moving research field with high publication volume.  
This repository provides a **reproducible, automated, and topic-structured** way to track recent work without manual searching.

It is suitable for:
- Diploma / Master theses
- PhD-level research
- Early-stage literature exploration
- Continuous SOTA tracking

## Automation

Updates are triggered automatically using GitHub Actions.  
To enable publishing:

1. Go to **Settings → Pages**
2. Select branch: `main`
3. Folder: `/docs`
